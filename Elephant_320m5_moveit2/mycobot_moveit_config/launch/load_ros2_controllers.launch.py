Launch ROS 2 controllers for the robot.

This script creates a launch description that starts the necessary controllers
for operating the robotic arm (WITHOUT gripper) in a specific sequence.

Launched Controllers:
    1. Joint State Broadcaster: Publishes joint states to /joint_states
    2. Arm Controller: Controls the robot arm movements via /follow_joint_trajectory

Launch Sequence:
    1. Joint State Broadcaster (delayed 10s to wait for Gazebo)
    2. Arm Controller (starts after Joint State Broadcaster)
